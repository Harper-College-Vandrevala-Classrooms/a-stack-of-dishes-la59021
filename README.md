# A Stack of Dishes 
## by A.J. L.

### Summary
This is a pair of headers and several programs writen in c++ that implements a class called Dish, and  .

The inplemented methods are:
- value(int n)
    - This returns the integer value of the nth triangular number.
- add(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger sum of the nth and mth triangular numbers.
- subtract(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger differance between the nth and mth triangular numbers.
- multiply(int n, int m)
    - This returns the interger product of the nth and mth triangular numbers
- divide(int n, int m)
    - This returns the double quotient of the nth and mth triangular numbers
- sequence(int n)
    - This returns a list containing all integer triangular numbers from 1 to n.

### Compilation
To compile the main program, that takes user inputs and builds a stack of dishes until the user is done then it prints and pops through the stack, use the command 
> make 1

To compile the test program, that preforms unit tests on a stack of dishes, use the command
> make 2

To compile the example program, that preforms the example provided at https://cyrusvandrevala.com/teaching/csc/122/labs/a-stack-of-dishes.html, use the command
> make 3
